An example of running this script to download images with a score greater than 50 from the wallpaper sub-reddit into a folder called wallpaper would be as follows:
    python redditdownload.py wallpaper wallpaper -s 50

And to run the same query but only get any new images, run the following:
    python redditdownload.py wallpaper wallpaper -s 50 -update
